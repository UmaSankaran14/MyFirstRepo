How can I download a specific folder or directory from a remote Git repo hosted on GitHub? 

If you are willing to use git to do this, you can do a sparse checkout.

We are going to start by creating an empty git repo locally, and then add the repository we want as a remote. This allows us to easily just checkout the folder we want

mkdir directoryName
cd directoryName
git init
git remote add origin -f repoUrl
After that, we want to add the directory to 

.git/info/sparse-checkout
(this is essentially the opposite of the gitignore file).

Then we can 

git pull origin master
and it should download only the folder you want.
